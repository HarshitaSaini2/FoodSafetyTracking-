## Project Title
**Food Safety Tracking**

## Project Description
The Food Safety Tracking project is designed to track the safety and origin of food products in the supply chain. It will enable consumers to check the origins of their food products and verify their safety status, ensuring that they have access to safe and trusted food items.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a transparent and traceable food supply chain powered by blockchain technology. By providing consumers with information on the origins and safety status of food items, we empower them to make informed decisions and promote food safety. This transparency will help build trust between producers and consumers while improving the overall food safety standard.

## Future Scope
Future enhancements for the Food Safety Tracking project include:
- **Integration with IoT Devices**: To track and monitor environmental conditions like temperature and humidity for perishable items, ensuring the food remains safe during transit.
- **Global Expansion**: Extending the platform to track food across the world, with real-time updates to ensure transparency.
- **Mobile Application**: Developing a mobile application where consumers can scan QR codes to see detailed information about their food products.
- **Certification Integration**: Adding certification features, where trusted authorities can verify the food safety credentials of food producers.

## Key Features
- **Food Traceability**: Allows consumers to trace food items to their origin, ensuring full transparency in the supply chain.
- **Producer Verification**: Food producers can verify the safety status of their products, ensuring trust and transparency.
- **Expiration & Batch Tracking**: Tracks and displays the expiration dates and batch numbers of food products, ensuring safety for consumption.
- **Decentralized Blockchain Data**: Data about the food products is stored on the blockchain, ensuring that the information is immutable and tamper-proof.
- **Consumer Accessibility**: Consumers can easily access detailed information about food items using a decentralized application (DApp) or directly from the contract interface.
